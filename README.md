### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
What can I do? under:
- ðŸ”­ In comparison, Vue3 is easier to use. If you know Vue3, of course you can also use Vue2 and TypeScript!
- ðŸŒ± Since you are a front-end developer, of course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are at your fingertips!
- ðŸ‘¯ For CSS, I know Less; for JavaScript, I know Jquery!
- ðŸ¤” Then responsive Bootstrap and lib-flexible are also must-haves!
- ðŸ’¬ If you know Vue, how can Uniapp not know it! What other packaging tools are there - Webpack!
- ðŸ“« For software engineering students, back-end skills are also mastered, such as the Express framework of Node.js!
- ðŸ˜„ The same is true for the database MySQL, and it is definitely necessary to use Navicat!
- âš¡ The last thing I learned a little bit about is Java, Python and Dart!
